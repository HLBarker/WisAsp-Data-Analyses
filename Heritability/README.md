This folder contains an R markdown file that explains heritability and how to calculate it with an example data set.

There are also two R function scripts in the R folder:
HeritabilityFunction.R -- calculates the broadsense heritability of a plant trait given a randomized complete block garden. This calculation
  also includes a fixed effect covariate (i.e., plant size)
TransformationFunction.R -- calculates the BoxCox transformation for the trait data in the heritability mixed effect model
