# WisAsp-Data-Analyses
Analyses for the WisAsp genetic mapping garden of Populus tremuloides for both genetic and phenotypic data.

These analyses include:

(1) genetic and phenotypic (pearson) correlations among aspen traits (e.g., growth, phytochemistry, etc.)

(2) associations between tree traits and insect community structure (e.g., how might tree traits shape associated insect communities?)

    - perMANOVA (with each individual tree)
    - Species indicator analyses (with tree genotype means for the 30 most and least extreme genotypes for a given trait)
    
(3) Genome-wide association (GWA), where SNPs are tested to infer whether they influence (or are in LD with genes that influence) the expression of the tree trait and/or subsequent organization of insect communities

    - SNP filtering pipeline
    - Population structure pipeline
    - GWA pipeline
